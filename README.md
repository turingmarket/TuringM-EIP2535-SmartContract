# TuringM-EIP2535-SmartContract

The current codebase contains most of the program logic. Only minor modifications are expected in the future (permission-related code updates, very limited program logic changes, bug fixes).

Please provide:

1. Complete smart contract audit quotation
2. Comprehensive audit process
3. Separate audit quotations for the 3 directories: contract1, contract2, contract3
 - the audit total price for each directory
 - the audit working days required for each directory
4. Maybe more additional information you think is necessary
